#+AUTHOR: Michael Cardiff
The purpose of this project is to practice my implmentations of various sorting algortihms. 
* Currently Implemented Algorithms
None Yet!

* Planned Algorithms
See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding#Algorithms_used_in_pathfinding][this link]] for the full list
- [ ] A* search
- [ ] Dijsktra's Algorithm

* HOW TO RUN
This is a Python 3 project, and should be explicitly run with =python3=. Simply run the following and the GUI will open:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 main.py
#+END_EXAMPLE
If you only have Python 3 installed, then you should just use:
